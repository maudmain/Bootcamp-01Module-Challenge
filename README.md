## Title
Code Refactor Challenge

## Description 
Task: This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


Acceptance Criteria
Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
Heading attributes fall in sequential order
Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title


## Usage 

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](assets/images/web-page-screenshot.png)

Note: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
