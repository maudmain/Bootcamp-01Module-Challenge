The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](assets/images/web-page-screenshot.png)

Note: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
